## Overview (slides)

Link to slides:

## Introduction to R and RStudio

* [Using RStudio and setting up projects](using RStudio and setting up projects: https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/00-before-we-start.html)
* See notes in `Tutorials/IntroToCompBio/IntroR.html` for the basic R materials you should cover in this section
* Save practice materials in script called `Practice.R`
* If extra time, use `mtcars` and `qplot` (will need to import tidyverse) with [this tutorial](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/qplot-quick-plot-with-ggplot2-r-software-and-data-visualization)

## Introduction to RNAseq analysis (slides)

* [myelofibrosis background](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/primary-myelofibrosis)

## Introduction to GitHub

* Sign up for GitHub account: use reasonable login name!
* Overview of GitHub interface
* Overview of GitHub Desktop App
* Use Desktop App to clone this repository

## Setting up our projects

* Open RNAseqProject through RStudio
* explain projects
* move practice script here

## RNAseq analysis

* Talk through script, emphasizing thought process
