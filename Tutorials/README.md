# Tutorials

Where to start?

## IntroToCompBio

This is an introduction to computational biology, including the following topics: 
- GitHub and GitHub Desktop
- R and Rstudio
  - Writing code in R
  - Basic data types (character, integer, numeric, logical, factors)
  - Introduction to R packages from CRAN and Bioconductor
  - Using a Notebook
  - RNAseq analysis

## Tidy Data, Data Structures and Data Quality

To create an analysis-ready data set, one often must clean and tidy a research data set and explore its structure.  
- Tidyverse, with special focus on pipes, dplyr, and long form data frames
- Intro to data visualization with ggplot2 for Data Quality assessments

## Data Analysis and Transformation

Once the data are in a form that lends itself well to being analyzed and basic data quality assessment is done, it's time to use an appropriate analysis or transformation process to create interpretable results.
- Using Bioconductor packages
- Intro to DESeq2, differential expression analysis and the ExpressionSet data structure

## Data Visualization

Data visualization can be critical for both understanding the data as well as any analysis or transformation thereof, especially when trying to convey meaning to other people.  
- Using ggplot2 to display your results
