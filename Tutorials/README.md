## Data Analysis and Transformation

Once the data are in a form that lends itself well to being analyzed and basic data quality assessment is done, it's time to use an appropriate analysis or transformation process to create interpretable results.
- Using Bioconductor packages
- Intro to DESeq2, differential expression analysis and the ExpressionSet data structure

## Data Visualization

Data visualization can be critical for both understanding the data as well as any analysis or transformation thereof, especially when trying to convey meaning to other people.
