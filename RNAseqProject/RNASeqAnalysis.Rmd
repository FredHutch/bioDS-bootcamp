# Instructions for using a notebook 

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. Execute a code chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. The results will appear beneath the code. Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

```{r example plot}
# create plot 
plot(cars)
```

# Install and load software 

If you do not already have Tidyverse and DESeq2 installed, this code will perform the task for you. You may be asked the following questions:

* "Update all/some/none"? type a (for all) and hit Enter
* "Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)" hit Enter 

```{r include=FALSE}
# install tools for data manipulation and plotting
install.packages("tidyverse")

# install tools for genomic analysis
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("DESeq2")

# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(DESeq2)
```

Note that you will need to *install* a package only once per computer, but you'll need to *load* the packages every time you reopen RStudio.
